Introduction

This assignment involves creating and analyzing a dataset of cricket bat products using Python. The main objective of this work is to understand how product data can be collected, structured, and analyzed in a format similar to real-world e-commerce platforms. The dataset focuses only on cricket bat products and is stored in CSV format for easy processing and analysis.

Objective

The objectives of this assignment are:

To generate a structured dataset related to cricket bat products

To understand product attributes such as price, discount, ratings, and stock availability

To perform basic data analysis and visualization using Python

To work with CSV files using pandas

Description of the Code

The Python notebook (Assignment.ipynb) contains code that simulates product data extraction and analysis for cricket bats. The code performs the following tasks:

Defines product-related fields such as name, brand, price, rating, reviews, discount, and stock status

Creates a pandas DataFrame to store cricket bat product details

Generates multiple product records to simulate real e-commerce listings

Performs basic analytical operations such as:

Price distribution analysis

Rating-based comparisons

Brand-wise aggregation

Discount and stock availability analysis

Displays results using tables and visualizations
